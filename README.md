# Coding Reading Club

## Motivations (Why?)

Why giving a course about reading code ?

- The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1.
  We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.
  Making it easy to read makes it easier to write. [^1] 
- "Code is read much more often than it is written, so plan accordingly" [^2] 

We do not deny the importance of writing code but there are already plenty of
courses on that. We propose instead a course to teach how to read code and
understand it.

## Who?

Anybody with good enough experience writing code. 
Master students are more likely to be qualified for the course but motivated
bachelor, with some coding knowledge, are welcomed.

**Languages**: C/Python will probably be the most common, even though other
languages could be considered (e.g., Haskell, Rust. No esotetic langauges though).  

## Goals

- Reading more code and understand it.
- Learning best practice.

## Implementation of the course

- Similar to a **Journal Club**: each week we decide a code that everybody has to
  read and understand. One of us is also responsible for it and has to present
  it (no need for slides, just describing it).
- At the end of the course a software is assigned to each student who is asked
  to give a report on how it works.

## Tools

- Visual studio
    - Search quickly for definition of variables/classes/functions
    - Use debugger, inspect variables

## How to read code which is not yours

- Run it
- Modify it and inspect variables
- Mental map / Physical map 
- Write down how you think it works (add citation)

- Q: Only reading or also coding ?

## Which code should we read ?

- The codebase should have some maximum number of lines (TBD, e.g. <= 1024)
- Why not the some famous snippets like "Quacke Fast Inverse Square Root"?
  (this usually are not very helpfull in pratice!)
